        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: September 23, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using the Core Finance application (the "Software").</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Software.</p>

        <h2>2. Use License</h2>
        <p>Permission is granted to download and use one copy of the Software for personal or small business commercial use. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in the application;</li>
            <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions.</p>

        <h2>3. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Software is provided "as is". The developer makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property. Further, the developer does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials in the Software.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall the developer be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the Software, even if the developer has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because all data is stored locally on the user's computer, the user is solely responsible for data backup and security.</p>

        <h2>5. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>Any claim relating to the Software shall be governed by the laws of Brazil without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
